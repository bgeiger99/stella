# Overall State

* Basics are done
* Interesting stuff is not
    * No OO, no structs
* Can run simple, unstructured benchmark
    * Fast, too
* ~2k SLOC
    * 600 SLOC tests

# Main work

* Stack -> Register
* Semantics of bytecodes

# Bumps along the way

* llvmpy and LLVM
    * Error messages are often bad!
    * Sometimes on errors LLVM simply calls `abort()`
    * Unidentified crashes with the default LLVM engine

# Avoiding pitfalls

* Use registers, not stack locations
    * Complicates logic
    * Unecessary because of optimization passes

# Requirements for compilation

* Based on *types*, not values*
    * Important for semantics, too

# Convenience features

* Default values, keyword arguments

~~~{.python}
def f(x, extra=0):
    ...
f(5)
f(6, extra=2)

# Open issues: SSA

~~~{.python}
    while obs_i < K and t < rununtiltime:
        if leg < substrate:
            R = koffp
        else:
            R = kcat
        t += exp(R)
~~~

# (So far) no copying back from \stella

* Global scalar changes not reflected in Python
* Structs will need this
    * Better approach necessary?
