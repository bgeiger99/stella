% \stella: Status Update

# Overall State

* Basics are done
* Interesting stuff is not
    * No OO, no structs
* Can run simple, unstructured benchmark
    * Fast, too
* ~2k SLOC
    * 600 SLOC tests

# llvmpy and LLVM

* Error messages are often bad!
* Sometimes on errors LLVM simply calls `abort()`

# Early optimization (or not)

* Registers vs stack locations

# Types are important

* Must be present for static typing
    * Important for semantics, too

# SSA Issues

~~~{.python}
    while obs_i < K and t < rununtiltime:
        if leg < substrate:
            R = koffp
        else:
            R = kcat
        t += exp(R)
~~~

# (So far) no copying back from \stella

* Global scalar changes not reflected in Python
* Structs will need this
    * Better approach necessary?
