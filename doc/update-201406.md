# Overall State

* Basics are done
* Interesting stuff is not
    * No OO, no structs
* Can run simple, *unstructured* benchmark
    * Fast, too
* ~2k SLOC
    * 600 SLOC tests

# Main work

* Stack -> Register
* Semantics of bytecodes
* Function calls
    * Calling C libraries
* Global variables
* (numpy) arrays

# Bumps along the way

llvmpy and LLVM
* Error messages are often bad!
* Sometimes on errors LLVM simply calls `abort()`
* Unidentified crashes with the default LLVM engine

# Avoiding pitfalls

* Use registers, not stack locations
    * Complicates logic
    * Unecessary because of optimization passes

# Requirements for compilation

* Based on *types*, not values*
    * Important for semantics, too

=> should allow easy caching of translations (not yet implemented)

# Convenience features

Keyword arguments with default values

~~~{.python}
def f(x, foo=0, bar=2):
    ...
f(5)
f(6, foo=2)
~~~

Obviously no dict expansion.

# Convenience features (2)

Transparent access to C libraries by using cython

* Wrap C function with identical Python names
* In \stella{} call C function
* Needs type annotations (missing cython feature?)
* Not yet automated (but would be easy to add)

# Open issues: SSA dominators

~~~{.python}
    while obs_i < K and t < rununtiltime:
        if leg < substrate:
            R = koffp
        else:
            R = kcat
        t += exp(R)
~~~

Solution: LLVM pass?

# (So far) no copying back from \stella

* Global scalar changes not reflected in Python
* Native ``structs'' will need this
    * Cost should be acceptable

* Arrays are directly updated (no copying)

# Benchmark 1: fibonacci

* (Side note: gcc much slower than clang, even at O3)

* Elapsed C: *18.13s*
* Elapsed Stella: *10.06s*
* Speed-Up: *1.80*
* (Stella+Compile: 10.09s)

# Benchmark 2: 1D one-legged spider walking

* Elapsed C: *57.56s*
* Elapsed Stella: *60.08s*
* Speed-Up: *0.96*
* (Stella+Compile: 60.14s)

# Next tasks

* tuples
* structs
* rewrite benchmark given these new features

# Open issues:

* Improved error messages
* Debugging within \stella
